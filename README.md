# TOWER_OF_HANOI


The Tower of Hanoi is also known as the Tower of Brahma or the Lucas Tower. It is a mathematical game or puzzle that consists of three rods with ’n’ number of disks of different diameters.

The objective of the game is to shift the entire stack of disks from one rod to another rod following these three rules :

   1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
   2. Only the uppermost disk from one stack can be moved on to the top of another stack or an empty rod.
   3. Larger disks cannot be placed on the top of smaller disks.
   
My code solves this puzzle using a recursive approach in C programming language .
